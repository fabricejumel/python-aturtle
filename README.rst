* To the creators and maintainers of `Tcl/Tk <https://www.tcl.tk/>`_, a programming language I used for a while in the late 1990's, in particular for the seriously under-appreciated `Canvas widget <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/canvas.htm>`_ which is amazingly powerful. Python embeds the Tcl/Tk interpreter in the form of the `tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html>`_ Standard Library module. Long live Tcl/Tk and `tkinter`!

* To whoever `Quarks <https://www.daniweb.com/members/228139/quarks>`_ is, for sharing an effective technique for debouncing Tk `KeyPress` / `KeyRelease` events in towards the end of `this thread <https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/70746/keypress-event-with-holding-down-the-key>`_.

* To `Terry Pratchet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett>`_, for his `Discworld <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld>`_ novels and, in particular, for `Great A'Tuin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_%28world%29#Great_A%27Tuin>`_, the *"Giant Star Turtle (...) who travels through the Discworld universe's space, carrying four giant elephants (...) who in turn carry the Discworld."*, which has come to my mind often while creating this.
